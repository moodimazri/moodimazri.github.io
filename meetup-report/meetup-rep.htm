It is one of the top universities in web development and technology. These students basically came to network with people from industry leaders such as Airbnb, Microsoft, Pinterest, and of course google developers. Interestingly, some of those leaders were at Hawset University, and attended the same meetup five years ago!Hence, these leaders emphasise the importance of these meetups and how it created a dream path for them to pursue!

"Jens Vanderhaeghe"</a> presented the architecture and the framework of airbnb system and how they started. He mainly described three things:
(1) the product drivers that precipitated the changes, (2) the steps they took to move away from the legacy Rails solutions, and (3) some of the key pillars of the new stack.

									<h4>Things that I learn from this meetups!</h4>
									<p>The meetup gathering and the social interaction are an amazing culture that exist in San Francisco! You can join as much as you want, and walk out with a bunch of information, and business cards. I had the oportiunity to meet with some developers and talk about their work and how they started. I was impressed by these industry leaders people such as Airbnb and Pinterest. Having talked to them, I realized that their hard work and persistent are what make them successful! Also, meeting with other students from Hawset University and having the opportunity to talk about their future prospect, gave me an insight of how all successful entrepreneur starts and how they think about the future.
